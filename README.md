# Art-Tycoon

The objective of Art Tycoon is to successfully gain a reputation as an artist and live indefinitely. Every month, you will need to pay $1000 in rent, and every canvas will cost you $500. Once your balance is below $5000, the game is over.

This was my AP Computer Science final project.
