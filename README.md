# Art-Tycoon

Art Tycoon is a game about trying to survive in the world of fine arts. Draw your minimalistic paintings and reach the top! 

The objective of Art Tycoon is to successfully gain a reputation as an artist and live indefinitely. Every month, you will need to pay $1000 in rent. Every canvas will cost you $500. Once your balance is below $5000, the game is over. The game is most difficult right at the start.

This was my AP Computer Science final project.
